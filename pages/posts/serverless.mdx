Serverless technology represents a paradigm shift in application development, enabling developers to build and run applications without managing servers. This approach not only simplifies deployment but also offers significant cost and performance benefits.

**Core Concepts of Serverless:**
1. **Function as a Service (FaaS):** Allows you to run individual functions in the cloud, which are triggered by events. AWS Lambda and Cloudflare Workers are prime examples.
2. **Event-Driven Architecture:** Serverless applications are often event-driven, responding to events such as HTTP requests, database changes, or file uploads.
3. **Microservices:** Encourages the use of microservices, where each service performs a single function, promoting modularity and reusability.

**Benefits of Serverless Technology:**
1. **Reduced Operational Overhead:** No need to manage, patch, or scale servers, reducing the operational burden on development teams.
2. **Scalability:** Serverless platforms automatically scale your applications in response to demand, ensuring they can handle any level of traffic.
3. **Cost Efficiency:** With a pay-per-use pricing model, you only pay for the resources your application consumes, leading to cost savings.

**Popular Serverless Platforms:**
1. **AWS Lambda:** A leading serverless platform offering deep integration with the AWS ecosystem.
2. **Azure Functions:** Microsoft's serverless solution, integrating seamlessly with Azure services.
3. **Google Cloud Functions:** Google's serverless offering, optimized for Google Cloud Platform services.
4. **Cloudflare Workers:** Focuses on edge computing, providing low-latency performance for web applications.

**Use Cases:**
- **Web Applications:** Build scalable web applications with minimal infrastructure management.
- **Data Processing:** Process data streams, logs, and files in real-time.
- **Automation:** Automate tasks such as backups, notifications, and deployments.

Serverless technology is transforming the landscape of application development by providing a more efficient and cost-effective way to deploy and manage applications, allowing developers to focus on writing code and delivering value.
